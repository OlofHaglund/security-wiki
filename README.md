# Why have a Security Wiki?
This is a place where I will store knowledge that I accumulate during my daily life or browsing the internet. There are many times I have found myself in situations where I have read about it but cannot recall where. Using references is crucial to get people to believe you. Having a wiki with a summary and to store the links I hope to solve this problem.

There a three steps to get good at something.
1) Learn it
2) Use it
3) Teach it

With this wiki, I can hopefully improve the first step.

Will everything be 100% correct?
I’m not claiming to be an expert on security just a know-how guy. And since this is mostly for me a lot of subjective notes can be found. I would recommend reading up on it yourself and form your own opinion.

# I don't agree with you!
That's sad. Create an issue or contact me and we can have a discussion. It is always fun to discuss security! And I’m not always in the right so I would happily be corrected if I’m wrong.
