# Why have a Security Wiki?
This is place were I will store knowledge that I accumulate during my daily life or browsing the internet. There are many times I have found my self in situations were I have read about it but cannot really recall were. Using references is crucial to get people to belive you. Having a wiki with a summary and to store the links I hope to solve this problem.

There a three steps to get good at something.
1) Learn it
2) Use it
3) Teach it

With this wiki I can hopefully improve the first step.

# Will everything be 100% correct?
I'm not claiming to be an expert on secruity just a know-how guy. And since this is mostly for myself alot of subjective notes can be found. I would recommend reading up on it yourself and form your own opinion.

# I don't agree with you!
Thats sad. Create an issue or contact me and we can have discussion. It is allways fun to discuss security! And I'm not allways in the right so I would happily be corrected if I'm wrong.
